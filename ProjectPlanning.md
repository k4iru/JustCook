# Technology

* Mongodb
* Express

# Reasons for using technology

We decided to use a MERN stack because JavaScript is an integral language to web development. It is the only language that can run natively in the browser so being able to use 1 programming language for both the front end and back end just makes sense. React is also a highly sought after skill in the job market.

# Part 2 

# Project Description

No shopping needed! For the busy professional that love to cook but not the shopping!

Pick a recipe online, get the ingredients delivered straight to you!

# Targeted Audience and Objective

Young professionals that like to cook home meals, but don't have a lot of time to go shopping for ingredients.

Our app allows users to quickly search up recipes for meals they want to try online then automatically order the ingredients necessary.

# Technical Considerations

* Database to save user recipes / information
* Instacart API to find and order ingredients
* An api to get recipes (potentially spoonacular, yummly)
* Express to server our React application
* React for Client side user interface
* Node for backend
* Using Redux for state management
* Authentication Security
* browser sessions
