# Description

JustCook is a Full Stack React Application built for the busy professional that loves to cook, but is too busy to go shopping. Users are able to search from a wide variety of recipes pulled from the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/) and add them to their cart. From there, users can checkout their cart and the ingredients needed along with recipe instructions will be shipped to them.
